        Tennis requires cat-like reflexes with short bursts of strength. These
        short movements do not allow the muscles to extend their full length.
        When muscles are strenuously worked they become tight and can lose their
        elasticity unless properly stretched. Yoga exercises can increase the
        body’s range of motion. The lack of movement because of inflexibility
        binds the joints. Without the elasticity of the muscles, I think an
        athlete can be a prisoner of his own body. Tennis requires cat-like
